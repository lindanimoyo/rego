Notes:
It's good to validate the results.
After data analysis, extrapolating the most abundant molecular targets as biomarkers of a particular condition is purely speculative without network reconstruction in specific confounding factors which could have influenced the study outcomes.

To emphasize the methodological contribution of the study, these other possible validation approaches can be done:
- Crossing different studies in databases that are related to the condition being studied.
- Sensitivity analysis.
- Co-occurence network analysis.
